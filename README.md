# math-game-concept
My school project, basicaly this is a GM(Game Master) for the game, it generates expresions, rolling the dice, accepting and validating the answers and timing. You are free to modify and improve the code. This project is not accepting AI generated answers. AI is good and i tried it but not here and not right now.
